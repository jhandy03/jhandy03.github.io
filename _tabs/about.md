Hey I'm Jordan Handy. I'm an aerospace engineering student studying at Virginia Tech. I'm from Los Angeles, California and I am 22 years old. 

My career interest lie within propulsion technologies. Specifically I am looking to pursue high speed air-breathing engines as my speciality. I will be graduating in May 2026 with plans to continue my education in a Master's Degree.

I currently serve as the Propulsion Lead for [MachWorks](https://mwvt.org), a design team I helped establish at Virginia Tech. We are looking to be the world's first collegiate team to tackle supersonic flight with our in-house designed and manufactured planes. We are currently working on our technology demonstrator Icarus, which aims to fly Fall 2025. For more information on my work for MachWorks, see [this post]({% post_url 2025-05-15-MW %})
